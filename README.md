# WELL-LOGGING-
This project uses a Self-Attention Convolutional Neural Network (SACNN) to enhance porosity prediction within Nigeria's oil and gas reservoirs, addressing the shortcomings of traditional characterization methods.

## Project Overview

This model integrates geological and geophysical data to improve the prediction accuracy of reservoir properties, specifically porosity, in Nigeria's challenging infrastructure and fluctuating market conditions.

## Features

- **Advanced ML Model:** Employs a SACNN to predict porosity with high accuracy.
- **Data Integration:** Combines well log data with seismic attributes from the SEG resource library.

## Data Source

The datasets utilized are sourced from the open SEG (Society of Exploration Geophysicists) resource library, focusing on capturing subtle variations that are critical for accurate reservoir characterization.
